### Discussion Items
- TSC nominations ended January 9, 2023. Michelle will send out the Google form for voting.
- Pratyaksh - PR/issue inactivity time
    - We have a logic to mark PR/issues stale after six months or auto-close them after two years. The proposal is to reduce it to 6 months.
    - Issues are piling up, giving the impression that the community is inactive.
    - Hudi community as an example: 1-1.5 months to mark inactive. Only 150-200 issues open
    - [Ying] The reason we have too many open issues is that we really have issues. Blindly closing those issues may let us lose attention to those issues.
    - [Tim] More ownership on the reporter to push for closing the issue also needs more effort in triaging the issues.
    - [Tim] We can reduce the stale bot time but track the issue turnaround time separately.
    - [Ying] We can categorize the issues and prioritize the bugs.
    - Pratyaksh to propose tags and stale/auto-close policies for PRs and issues.
- TPC-H and TPC-DS plan analysis
    - At a high level, it is good.
    - We made the best effort to make an apple-to-apple comparison. We turned off the fragment result cache, IO cache. We used the same # of nodes, instance type, compatible cloud environment.
    - Issue 1 (planner) - In case of unknown estimated stats on filter predicate, optimizer is unable to proceed resulting in wrongful join order. e.g. Q9 ,Q21 are mainly impacted
        - Solution: Use default filtering factor 0.9 if unknown stats is encountered `default_filter_factor_enabled=true`
        - [Rebecca] It might make sense to enable this by default but also It is really data-dependent.
        - [Rebecca, Bill] Long-term, a better selectivity estimation should be the way to go.
    - Issue 2 (planner) - Dynamic filtering introduces an extra project operator that prevent join reordering logic from working properly.
        - Solution: Fix the optimizer code to defer applying dynamic filtering until join reorder
        - Trino with the fix performed better, but Presto with the fix didn’t show much difference.
    - Issue 3 (planner) - Transform a Left Outer Join to an Inner join can improve performance if both the outer and the inner side of tables do not contain null values.
        - Solution: enable `optimize_nulls_in_join=true` to append `is not null` predicate
    - Issue 4 (planner) - Transformation of a Semi Join to an Inner Join can improve performance in certain scenarios, and Q18 is the impacted one. Early out join will fix the issue.
        - [https://github.com/prestodb/presto/pull/18381](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/pull/18381)
    - Issue 5 (planner) - In Q17, partial aggregation does not reduce a good amount of rows for both trino and presto. However, the CPU time is very different. Trino implements an adaptive partial aggregation that bypasses the partial step if the low reduction is encountered in runtime.
        - Trino optimization in runtime: [https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/11011](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/11011)
    - Issue 6 (runtime) - Q13/Q16 with LIKE or NOT LIKE wildcard performs worse than trino for presto.
        - Trino has made custom NFA/DFA based matcher that improves LIKE matching performance drastically
        - https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/13479
    - Issue 7 (runtime) - In-List optimization for q22: Plan is the same for presto and trino in q22. However, Trino made some improvement to process  an In-list more efficiently. It’s observed that in presto without an in-list predicate, the query runs 27% faster
        - [https://www.notion.so/ahanaio/926777c06e1f46018c9e70db3bbfe592#c6339b5f21594f4f9be2e666ab059fc1](https://www.notion.so/926777c06e1f46018c9e70db3bbfe592)
        - [https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/8833](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/8833)
        - Filter evaluation using lambda expression
            - Trino has a different way to implement function call codegen e.g. [https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/8012](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/8012)
    - Why presto is faster than Trino if the plans are the same - One of the main factors is due to Parquet reader with batch read optimization.
